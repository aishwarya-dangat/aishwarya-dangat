# Hi, I'm Aishwarya 👋

I'm a **Cognitive Neuroscientist** based in Rome, Italy, with an MSc from Sapienza University of Rome. My research sits at the intersection of **psychophysiology, neuroimaging, and mental health** — I'm particularly interested in how the brain processes reward, regulates stress, and how individual differences in these processes relate to psychological wellbeing.

## 🧠 Research Interests
- EEG & fMRI data collection and analysis
- Psychophysiology (HRV, ERP, stress response)
- Reward processing & repetitive negative thinking
- Computational approaches to understanding brain dynamics
- Cognitive neuroscience of mental health

## 🔬 Research Experience
- **Brain Imaging Lab, Sapienza / Santa Lucia Foundation** — fMRI study on neural mechanisms of reach-to-grasp actions (NCM Conference Poster, 2024)
- **Ottaviani Lab, Sapienza** — EEG study on reward processing deficits in repetitive negative thinking (*Psychological Medicine*, Schettino et al., 2026)
